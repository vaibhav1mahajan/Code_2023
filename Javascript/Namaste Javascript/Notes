Everything in javascript happens inside an execution context
It is like a big box and it has two components
    1. Memory component or variable environment where all the function and variable are stored as key value pair
    2. Code component or thread of execution in which code is executed line by line 

Javascript is synchronous single threaded language , it means it will execute only one line at a time    

Lecture: 02

var n = 2 ; 
function square(num) {
    return num*num;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);

Before a single line will execute , a global execution context is made. This execution context is created in two phases.
    First phase is also known as memory creation phase.
    In first phase, it will allocate memory to 'n' and store value of undefined and in case of function it stores the whole code 
    Second phase is code execution phase.
    Now,javascript once again runs through whole javascipt program line by line(All calculation is done).
    Now as soon as first line is executed it will place value of n at the place of undefined, and from line 2 to 5 there is nothing to executed
