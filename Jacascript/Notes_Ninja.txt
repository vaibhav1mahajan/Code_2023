1 - The possibilities are endless with javascript , we can do mobile development, create a VR game , program robots etc
2 - It's evolving so rapidly.

3 - There are several types of data Types :
    1. Number
    2. String
    3. Boolean
    4. Null (Explicitly set variable with no value)
    5. Undefined (For variable that have not been defined)
    6. Object (Complex Data Strcture - Arrays)
    7. Symbol (Used with objects)

4 - String Method 
    1.  indexOf() : give index of first occurance of that char
    2.  lastIndexOf() : give index of last occurance of that char
    3. slice(begin index, end index(Exclusive)) : give substring
    4. substr(begin index , length of substr) : give substring

5 - NaN : not a number

6- Arrays Methods
    1. join() : make array into string , you can pass argument as well to join specific char in between
    2. indexOf() : give index of argument

7 - Boolean
    In javascript lowercase letter are greater than uppercase letter

    if you compare console.log('crystal' > 'shaun')  it gives false , comparison starts with first letter and go on where a difference comes.

8 - Type Conversion
    1. score = Number(a); , converts string into number , if it is possible

    2. String(a) , converts into string
    3. Boolean(a) : concept of falsy and truty value
