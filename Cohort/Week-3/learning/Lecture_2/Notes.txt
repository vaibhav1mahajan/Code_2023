Hashing
No decryption is there (1way) doesn't require password

Encryption
we can convert random string into password back provided we have key (2 way)


Json web token
Takes json as input, creates a token, not hashed not protected
Anyone as token can see the json
Anyone can convert it but only backend server is verify it
It's technically a digital signature

Databases
Why do we need them?
In in memory database if our server crashes then our all updated data will be lossed

Architecture of Databases
1-users hit the backend
2-backend hits the database
3- user don't have access to the databases/ can't talk to db
