Types of languages
1. A procedural language is a type of computer programming language that specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures within its programming context to compose a program

2. Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In functional programming languages, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables.

3. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

Static vs Dynamic

1. Static 
    1. Perform type checking at compile time
    Compile time : The source code that you wrote gets converted into machine code is known as compilation (compile time).
    2. Errors will show at compile type
    3. Declare data type before you use it
    4. More control

2. Dynamic
    1. Perform type checking at runtime.
    Runtime: When machine code is running
    2. Error might not show till program is run.
    3. No need to declare datatype of variablels
    4. Save time in writing the code but might give error at runtime.


There are two types of memory:
    1. Stack Memory: Contains variable names
    2. Heap Memory:  Stores original objects

If the change is made via one variable then it will be changed for all variables that are pointing the object.

Objects with no refrence variables are deleted or removed when garbage collection hits
