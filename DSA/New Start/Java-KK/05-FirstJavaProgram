javac -d .. Main.java // d flag is used to store byte at any particular location

package: It is the folder in which your java files lies

Data types which can't be break down into further data types are known as primitive data types 

All the decimals values we have in java have by default of type double so we need to add literal f in end of float data type , same for long we need to add L literal 

In Java, a literal is a source code representation of a fixed value. It is a constant or a value that is used exactly as it appears, without computation or further evaluation.

input.next() takes single word where as input.nextLine() takes whole line as input

Automatic type conversion takes place , firstly two types should be compatible and second one destination type should be greater than source type

Automatic type promotion in expressions
int a = 257;
byte b = (byte)(a) // give   a % 256(max range)

byte a = 50;
byte b = 20;
byte c  = 30;
int d = a*b/c;

The result of intermediate term a*b should easily exceed byte range , to handle this type of problem java automatic promote this to integer and then perform this operations

Due to above reason we can't to something like this 
byte b = 50;
 b = b*2


Java follows unique code values
