What is class ?
A class is named grouped of property and function.A class is an tempelate of objects and object are instance of class.A class creates a new data type that can be used to create objects.
When you declare an object of a class, you are creating an instance of that class.
Thus, a class is a logical construct. An object has physical reality. (That is, an object occupies space in memory.)

Objects are characterized by three essential properties: state, identity, and behavior.
The state of an object is a value from its data type. The identity of an object distinguishes one object from another.
It is useful to think of an objectâ€™s identity as the place where its value is stored in memory.
The behavior of an object is the effect of data-type operations.

The dot operator links the name of the object with the name of an instance variable.
ann instance variable is a variable that is bound to an instance of a class.

Student students = new Student();
by default value is null, when it is not initialized
For object its is null but for primitive it may be different

The 'new' keyword dynamically allocates(that is, allocates at run time)memory for an object & returns a reference to it.
This reference is, more or less, the address in memory of the object allocated by new.
This reference is then stored in the variable.
Thus, in Java, all class objects must be dynamically allocated.
