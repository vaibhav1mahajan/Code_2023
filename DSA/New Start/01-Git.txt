GitHub is a online platform or website that allows us to host GitHub
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently.
Features of Git
1. Version control

2. Distributed System : Unlike centralized version control systems, Git is distributed.  Each developer has a complete copy of the repository on their local machine. This means that developers can work independently and commit changes locally before sharing them with others.

3. Branching and Merging:
Git encourages the use of branches, which are separate lines of development. Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be merged back into the main branch when the changes are ready.

Commands
1. git status         : Shows untracked files
2. git add            : Stage changes for the next commit
3. git commit         : Save the changes that have been staged using git add to the version history.
4. cat                : Used for concatenating and displaying the contents of files.
5. git restore --staged names.txt : to unstaged the files(If somehow we staged unwanted files)
6. git log             :  Shows history of commits  
7. git reset hashId    :  Unstage all the commits above it
8. git stash           :  To send files in backstage
9. git stash clear     :  To clear stash files forever
10 git stash pop       :  To bring out backstage files onto staged
11.git remote add origin(any name) : To attach url to our local project
12.git remote -v       : Shows all the url attached to this folder
13.git push origin(url name) master(branch name): Push changes or commits to the selected branch
14.git branch feature(branch name)   : creates a new branch 
15.git checkout feature(branch name) : Head moves to new branch
16.git clone (url)          : cloning existing project
17.git remote add upstream (url) : from where you have forked this project

For every branch you can create only one pull request , hence for every feature or bug you need to create new branch

You need to force push if you want to delete some commit from url
18. git push origin master -f: force push to url
19. git fetch --all --prune : To fetch all the changes from main branch
    git checkout main
20. git reset --hard upstream/main :  To move head of our branch to upstream branch
21. git pull upstream main : Will do same as combine of above 3
22. git rebase -i hashId   : Choose pick and s(Squash) , this command will merge several commits into one and after that use :x
